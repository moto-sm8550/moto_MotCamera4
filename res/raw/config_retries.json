//1.The purpose to add this "retry feature" was only helping Zach to pass the ESD verification,
//at that time, Zach's HW was lockdown and it was the end of the project.
//So we add this pure workaround for it from SW.
//2.The default value of retry is 2 times and each time have 0.5 second delay in JsonConfig.java.
//NUM_OF_RETRIES = 2, DELAY_TIME_OF_RETRIES = 500.
//3.The number of retry in the config file will override the default value we set in Java layer.
//4.Will showing a black screen if error and retry, the maximum black screen up
//about (retryNum * delaySeconds) seconds, e.g. will showing maximum black screen 9s(3*3),
//if we set retrNum to 3 and each time have 3s delay.
